# qtileCustomConfig
Customized config for Qtile based on Arco Linux defaults


<strong>Note: Since these files where written for Arco Linux, if you want to use it on other OSes please check the config files for any program that you don't have.</strong>

If there was any line in codes which you didn't need just comment it, but if qtile didn't restart after your modification or changed to the default layout, you've made a mistake in config file(or commented some important lines)

Qtile is a window manager for Linux, see more information here:
<a href link="http://www.qtile.org/">Qtile website</a> 

For using these files, copy them into   <code>~/.config/qtile</code>   folder,
Then logout or restart Qtile(based on default shortcuts).

Keyboard shortcuts are defined inside <code>sxhkd/sxhkdrc</code>
The default Terminal emulator is <strong>Alacritty</strong> and default browser is <strong>Firefox</strong> but you cand also change it in <code>sxhkd/sxhkdrc</code>

You should have <code> Ubuntu </code> and <code> SauceCodePro Nerd Font</code> <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/">(found here)</a> and <code>Source Code Pro</code> fonts on your device but again you can change it on <code>config.py</code>
